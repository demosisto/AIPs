## Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the AIP.-->
This AIP is to describe a consolidated blogging platform and mechanism for publishing. 
The proposed platform will run in an independent way and environment. It would be maintained by the Agora core teams. 
The proposed mechanism will heavily rely on the expertise management and maintenance from the Agora core teams and community.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
The Agora PEN is the first feature proposed as a separated platform to preach Agora's creeds and concepts across the boundaries of the community. 
The Agora core teams are responsible for the operation and marketing collaborated with the community as well as the outside collaborators.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Agora platforms.-->
Discussion at the [PEN organizing team](https://github.com/orgs/agorahub/teams/pen).

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.-->
Aggregated presentation takes advantage of the user generated contents in terms of credibility, enrichment and coherence in the post social media times. 
The Agora core teams will refine more comprehensive doctrine and update the community with the newest development on the edge.

## Implementation
<!--The implementation must be completed before any AIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the AIP is accepted.-->
